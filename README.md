# ðŸ§­ Let's draw

This is a learning project focused on using the **Qt framework** and **Python** for creating 2D graphical applications.  
It explores both **Qt (via PySide6)** and **Pygame** for building interactive visual experiences â€” such as robot faces with animated emotions ðŸ¤–.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

Follow these steps to get up and running:

1. **Install Python 3**
   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3
   ```

2. **Create and Activate Python Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   # Create a new virtual environment
   python3 -m venv venv

   # Activate the virtual environment
   source venv/bin/activate

   # Your prompt should change to indicate you're in the virtual environment
   # To deactivate the virtual environment when you're done:
   # deactivate
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**
   ```bash
   # Make sure your virtual environment is activated
   pip install PySide6
   pip install pygame
   ```

4. **Run the project**  
   Replace `<your_script.py>` with the name of your Python file:
   ```bash
   python3 robot_face_new.py
   ```

5. **Deactivate Python Virtual Enviroment**
   When you are done  deactivate the virtual environment when you're done:
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```
